who likes going to the hospital ?,1
"we have listed our old house with ruth , and the great service continues .",1
as well as their recommendation of mortgage servicing company .,1
this is a fun shoe store in a great neighborhood .,1
ten toes is a great personal shoe store surrounded by big businesses in shadyside .,1
"my first time to visit , and i hit a great sale .",1
they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .,0
this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .,0
there was no attendant at the booth when we left .,0
"luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .",0
bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .,0
"lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .",0
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .,0
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .,0
when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .,0
at this office any reservation you have is basically worthless .,0
nor has the manager ever returned my message .,0
"i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .",0
"frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .",0
"maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .",0
"i want to like this place , but just ca n't .",0
the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .,0
"if i could give less than one star , i would .",0
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .,0
ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .,0
it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .,0
the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .,0
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .,0
did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .,0
"and once again , pretty nasty .",0
no thanks .,0
"three strikes jackson 's , you wo n't see me again .",0
walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .,0
"the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .",0
will not be staying here again .,0
the place was so slow .,0
$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .,0
this was not a four star dining experience .,0
really disappointing .,0
no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .,0
but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .,0
four star _num_ diamond yea right .,0
no creativity to the cooking .,0
"at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .",0
the steak was overcooked .,0
the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .,0
"turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .",0
most of our bill was the wine .,0
could have being very good but it was not .,0
"i find it acceptable , but nothing special .",0
"in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .",0
"the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .",0
i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .,0
bad food .,0
bug problem .,0
also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .,0
nothing special on this menu ... .,0
"the food , on the other hand , is not good .",0
spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .,0
it was n't even spicy .,0
"no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .",0
"by now , my companions had finished eating .",0
"the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .",0
nothing to write home about .,0
do n't understand the hype .,0
not a good dinner place .,0
this showmars used to be awesome .,0
i would have given it _num_ stars .,0
this showmars is under new management and it sucks !,0
"also , the portions are not as big .",0
change management and has gone down hill .,0
"it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .",0
missed opportunity .,0
gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .,0
major disappointment !,0
"i asked wth and they told me , management change .",0
that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .,0
"good food , but poor service at this particular location .",0
a shame .,0
"i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .",0
i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?,0
and everything is ala carte !,0
no way .,0
i was not impressed by anything here .,0
but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .,0
he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .,0
the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .,0
as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .,0
highly disappointed !,0
the last two times i have been there were not good .,0
it appears that the oven was too hot .,0
my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .,0
poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .,0
nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .,0
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .,0
an hour .,0
_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .,0
we do n't care !,0
i wish i could leave a no star rating .,0
service was awful .,0
the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .,0
worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !,0
we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .,0
at this point we still had not seen our server .,0
i poured my own wine refills .,0
we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .,0
very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .,0
even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .,0
_num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .,0
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .,0
ridiculous .,0
this last experience was by far the most disappointing .,0
_num_ sides came out late .,0
"i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .",0
so i had to eat my sides cold .,0
the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?,0
they made it anyway and gave it to me .,0
there is no excuse .,0
they did not have many items .,0
do they not make fresh brew coffee .,0
maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .,0
starbucks is not the right one for me .,0
not like you starbucks !,0
"cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .",0
but this was pretty bad .,0
"ok , mistake .",0
it just is n't up my alley though .,0
also the bathrooms where in bad shape .,0
i really hate this place .,0
"i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .",0
food was awful .,0
"staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .",0
"this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .",0
simply a bad experience .,0
the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .,0
i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .,0
pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .,0
at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .,0
the beer specials and _num_ .,0
seems he was already looking to replace the manager .,0
we walked in and it was awkward .,0
no waitress no one else walking around .,0
"we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .",0
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .,0
will not be back .,0
we just received the worst service ever i will never come back .,0
service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .,0
it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .,0
it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .,0
"to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !",0
"a shame , really , for my once favorite bar in charlotte .",0
went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .,0
the music was too loud for conversation .,0
"summary : very noisy , terrible service .",0
wild dogs could n't drag me back .,0
i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .,0
my braised short ribs were all bones !,0
"i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .",0
been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .,0
we will not be going back .,0
"apparently , reservations are not valued here .",0
he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .,0
did n't get our food until after _num_ .,0
food is n't good either .,0
greasy and the batter was peeling off .,0
i did n't get what i ordered .,0
i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .,0
it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .,0
"stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .",0
"so , we again waited & never did see a server .",0
there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .,0
even adding salt and pepper did not help it .,0
"i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .",0
easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .,0
for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .,0
the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .,0
that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .,0
i will not be coming back .,0
just average unfortunately .,0
the mediocre : everything else .,0
the really really low point of the meal was the desert .,0
the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .,0
and questioned why it was cold .,0
bread pudding is always warm no ?,0
lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .,0
even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .,0
never going back .,0
"the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .",0
"and , all were nothing to write home about .",0
not worth it .,0
"know your customers , bring back the stew .",0
hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !,0
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .,0
worst lunch option uptown .,0
i will not be returning .,0
my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .,0
server was very slow and was n't attentive .,0
bouncer was extremely rude .,0
we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .,0
it took _num_ minutes to get our server to take our dinner order .,0
it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .,0
the food came quick but no potato soup .,0
the service itself was n't to great either .,0
the wait staff was not that great either !,0
the bartenders attitude were like `` we r annoyed cause we r there '' .,0
we walked in and waited to be sat .,0
no one came or even looked at us .,0
the bartender looked at us walked away .,0
after _num_ minutes he never returned .,0
when i come back to charlotte i wo n't be trying this restaurant again .,0
i had carryout .,0
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .,0
so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .,0
i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .,0
still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !,0
"sad to say , my entree was a little bland .",0
"it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .",0
"food is decent , but service is no good .",0
"unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .",0
will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .,0
they are rude .,0
literally rude .,0
half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .,0
no in this restaurant are polite .,0
"unfortunately , the food was sub-par .",0
i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .,0
i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .,0
the worst part were the soy beans .,0
when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .,0
"otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .",0
"if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .",0
the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .,0
the lady at the front desk is absolutely rude rude rude rude .,0
disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .,0
so sad .,0
used to be so much better .,0
no flavor .,0
everything we ordered was very very bland .,0
very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .,0
wo n't be back .,0
i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .,0
fried dumplings were thick and mushy .,0
the ramen soup was bland .,0
egg roll was sour of all things .,0
hot and sour soup also bland .,0
very bland .,0
very very bland .,0
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .,0
nor is there any hint of a true thai taste .,0
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .,0
"again , very bland .",0
not much of a coconut taste either .,0
the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .,0
not sure if i 'll try again .,0
"instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .",0
waste of a cheat meal .,0
worst chinese food i 've had in a while .,0
have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?,0
this seemed quite bizarre .,0
"also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?",0
why give french fries with most of them burned ?,0
food is terrible .,0
"everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .",0
the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .,0
"it 's my fault , i guess .",0
the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !,0
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?,0
i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .,0
flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .,0
"aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .",0
"as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .",0
what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .,0
i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .,0
horrible experience .,0
the bread was cold and hard .,0
"we had to go , it was getting way too late .",0
went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .,0
the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .,0
tried their philly cheese steak .,0
sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .,0
as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .,0
"the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .",0
"i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .",0
"when my food came out , the chicken was cold .",0
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .,0
it was kind of uncomfortable .,0
no management present that we could see .,0
"so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?",0
it 's horrible .,0
i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .,0
"so , you get where this is going , right ?",0
"walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .",0
room three does n't smell much better .,0
"again , stale and moldy .",0
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .,0
but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .,0
not a good sign .,0
this place is not worth the price !,0
only _num_ stars for location .,0
worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .,0
"wow , i was wrong .",0
we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .,0
i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .,0
i found all of this very unacceptable .,0
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .,0
two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .,0
but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .,0
the room i stayed in was old and run down .,0
the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .,0
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .,0
my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .,0
"loud , loud , loud !",0
this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .,0
the `` new '' rooms are terrible .,0
for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .,0
terrible for business travel .,0
"no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .",0
no desk type chair .,0
which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !,0
just a poor design all around .,0
rooms are poorly designed .,0
faux wood floor makes everything echo .,0
in fact faux wood furniture all around .,0
while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .,0
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?,0
the room are _num_ stars .,0
when we got back to our hotel .,0
_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !,0
both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .,0
stomach hurts all night .,0
"oh well , their loss .",0
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .,0
i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .,0
terrible customer service !,0
"menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .",0
"waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .",0
the place was empty when we got there and when we left .,0
... no wonder .,0
one star because zero was n't an option .,0
oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross .,0
nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .,0
they just said thank you and walked away .,0
we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .,0
was not impressed at all .,0
did not taste like hibachi at all .,0
"sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .",0
i just had such a bad experience here .,0
"the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .",0
do n't even get me started .,0
but the service is horrible .,0
"if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .",0
i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .,0
do n't think i 'll be coming back .,0
i used their online service to pick up my laundry .,0
for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .,0
i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .,0
an expensive hassle for such terrible service .,0
what a mistake it was .,0
but they are n't reliable .,0
"he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .",0
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .,0
they do n't care about your clothes .,0
pay more elsewhere for better quality .,0
i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .,0
"i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .",0
there was nothing really special about the food .,0
i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .,0
needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .,0
could n't you have just lied to me and told me you were out ?,0
"dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .",0
just dont expect anything amazing .,0
that might make it a little better .,0
"their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .",0
"the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .",0
but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .,0
ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .,0
"our server , from beginning to end , was slow .",0
would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .,0
also they were not that tender .,0
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .,0
"while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .",0
"i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .",0
"unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .",0
too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .,0
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .,0
unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .,0
i will not be going back .,0
"the food was bad , yo .",0
"like , below applebee 's bad .",0
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .,0
i was n't impressed with this place .,0
the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .,0
"i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .",0
"way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .",0
we walked out and still nobody noticed .,0
this used to be my favorite place uptown .,0
really disappointed .,0
"really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?",0
the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !,0
not sure we would return anytime soon .,0
bad service and mediocre food served cold .,0
the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .,0
if i could give negative star rating i would .,0
it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .,0
chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .,0
"more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .",0
"the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .",0
i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .,0
we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .,0
"the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .",0
i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .,0
"the wings were fine , but nothing special .",0
"the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .",0
overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .,0
"then no , i have not gotten my beer .",0
she again left for another _num_ minutes .,0
"was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?",0
the chicken was supposed to be grilled .,0
fries with burger were luke warm .,0
"as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .",0
but obviously we have no plans to go back .,0
ick !,0
half the time our drinks were empty .,0
so what was the point in an app ?,0
there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .,0
no lobster .,0
caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .,0
i 'd give it zero stars but yelp wo n't let me .,0
i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .,0
tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .,0
there are no free meals in america andrea !,0
i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !,0
we had the worst experience at this place !,0
it ruined our first visit in charlotte .,0
their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !,0
"establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .",0
this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .,0
"fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .",0
apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .,0
bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .,0
unacceptable .,0
i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .,0
"i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .",0
not edible .,0
came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .,0
the chicken was flavorless and tough .,0
the fries were cold and mushy .,0
will not come back here .,0
the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .,0
the food was also disappointing .,0
the chicken breast was so small .,0
worse was that there was no flavor .,0
it was just all around bland .,0
would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .,0
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .,0
gross .,0
bartenders were terrible and not attentive .,0
waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .,0
unacceptable .,0
do the bartenders here not work on tips ?,0
only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .,0
nobody tried to even convince us to stay .,0
2nd time service was extremely slow .,0
nothing that really stands out .,0
the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .,0
_num_ minutes later we were sat .,0
some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .,0
neither of us touched our food .,0
another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .,0
no checks .,0
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .,0
finally i flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager .,0
"well , the customer service did n't get much better .",0
i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .,0
i was starving so at this point i just made do .,0
"when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .",0
the veggies were overly salty table round .,0
and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .,0
after _num_ more min .,0
i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .,0
the broccoli was terrible .,0
"the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .",0
"i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .",0
"in short , our experience here was awful .",0
the burgers were just okay .,0
not particularly flavorful but edible .,0
the sticks were not actually pretzels .,0
"the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .",0
the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .,0
the chicken tacos were good .,0
i personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold .,0
"they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .",0
the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .,0
the service was awful .,0
it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .,0
"and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .",0
it was not a gluten free menu at all !,0
very disappointed with this restaurant .,0
this place was horrible !,0
do n't get married here .,0
that was $ _num_ down the drain .,0
"this place is beautiful but not worth the money , stress , or headache .",0
fish was not fresh .,0
the manager claims he is very helpful ?,0
he is not !,0
this fast food place almost always gets my order wrong .,0
they charge me for things that they do n't have .,0
"besides the staff being extremely unprofessional , the wait time is always long .",0
"the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .",0
"seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .",0
do n't waste your time ... .,0
this is not a really cool hang out .,0
the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .,0
the place just seemed small and shabby to me .,0
"the restaurant was pretty empty , no wait for a table .",0
we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .,0
"we just ignored this and ate the calamari , as is .",0
the crab dip was another disappointment .,0
the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .,0
"wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .",0
i had about _num_ bites and just put it aside .,0
"the food was decent but _num_ issues , _num_ major one .",0
first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .,0
"it was very , very bad .",0
very bad .,0
so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .,0
i will tell people not to go there and i will never go back .,0
[ the bad . ],0
the temperature in the restaurant was hot .,0
"_num_ outside , _num_ inside .",0
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .,0
"he said , `` we only have _num_ .",0
we usually have _num_ but we ran out of _num_ today . '',0
my order was wrong .,0
i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .,0
the beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality .,0
[ the not so bad . ],0
like i said maybe just an off night but we wo n't be back .,0
"so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .",0
restaurant dot com you 've let me down once again .,0
i 've got to ask myself why do i keep doing this .,0
"no excuse for an overcooked steak ever , and all ordered medium rare .",0
avoid this place even if free .,0
very poor service .,0
the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .,0
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .,0
the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .,0
the potatoes were like tater tots .,0
no ketchup ?,0
"it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .",0
this could be an awesome place to stay .,0
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .,0
"i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .",0
i get to the room and the electronic key does not work .,0
his key does not work either .,0
later they apologize for the error .,0
the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .,0
a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen .,0
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .,0
i absolutely hate this place .,0
"btw , no one ever showed up to fix the air .",0
this is the first time i feel compelled to write a bad review .,0
the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .,0
it was not my pillow .,0
( but they have still not done this _num_ weeks later ) .,0
i can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service .,0
the beds were uncomfortable .,0
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .,0
i will never be back .,0
do not stay here if you have a choice .,0
"to add insult to injury , the only restaurant in the hotel sucks .",0
no concierge .,0
the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .,0
do n't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler .,0
i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .,0
"two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .",0
so why the low rating ?,0
here 's the bad points .,0
wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion .,0
big disappointment ... try the hilton .,0
but its definitely not worth the money .,0
"the fitness center lacks a fan , so working out gets too hot .",0
i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .,0
"otherwise , i will never stay at this place .",0
there are much better choices in uptown charlotte !,0
now the bad ... stains .,0
there is no other way to describe everything in my room .,0
they just need a better starting product !,0
i did not find the venue pleasant .,0
it was then i noticed small mold spots in the shower .,0
the ac in the room also did not seem to operate properly .,0
no way it got near _num_ or i would have been freezing .,0
got _num_ bites for one night .,0
he also suggested me to go to er if not getting better .,0
obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .,0
"conference rooms were poorly set-up , freezing cold , and loud !",0
avoid the valet at all costs !,0
description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .,0
the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .,0
either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .,0
"at _num_ am and two phone calls , still no coffee .",0
no apologies .,0
"big box , impersonal hotel .",0
the views are not worth it .,0
time to check out and never come back .,0
staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball .,0
the hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment .,0
total time spent _num_ hour for a $ _num_ drink .,0
no ... not a sir and i wanted to order mozzarella wheels .,0
`` oh ok that 'll be $ _num_ . '',0
i pretty much hate this hotel .,0
this hotel is a complete ripoff !,0
"other than that , customer service is awful .",0
the restaurant is the worst .,0
and they got my order wrong .,0
how the heck do you get that order wrong ?,0
we were disappointed in this hotel .,0
lobby bar staff was unfriendly .,0
we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .,0
the phone call from the manager @ 7:00 am ruined the trip for me .,0
"i did n't appreciate it , understand it , or like it at all .",0
this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .,0
i even asked my husband to check in case i missed it .,0
i waited about _num_ mins and still no menu .,0
"we check in , we get the wrong room .",0
their televisions could be called outdated ... at best .,0
they tried to fix the broken telephone but were n't really successful .,0
i stayed here for a week .,0
i dunno .,0
both experiences have been terrible .,0
"it was fixed promptly , but made a bad first impression .",0
quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life .,0
"noisy , dirty , poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man .",0
does n't even deserve one star in my book .,0
avoid at all costs !,0
the rooms were clean but i would not stay here again .,0
it 's awful and we wo n't be going back .,0
the worst of our experience ?,0
"if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .",0
there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .,0
"under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .",0
the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .,0
the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .,0
we tried to nap but simply could n't .,0
more screaming and yelling than the night before .,0
it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .,0
the staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything .,0
i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .,0
i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .,0
when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .,0
i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !,0
no way would i ever stay at this motel again .,0
"beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .",0
no more .,0
veterans beware !,0
do not stay st this hotel .,0
do n't expect too much .,0
the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .,0
not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .,0
we went on a friday and it was n't too busy .,0
and they did n't seem too concerned about my complaint .,0
and the bathrooms were nasty .,0
bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work .,0
sorry for the comment .,0
i signed up as they knocked at my door .,0
i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .,0
only because they were my only option .,0
time warner cable is awful .,0
"also , they really have the worst customer service i have ever dealt with .",0
its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone ?,0
would that have been so difficult ?,0
well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .,0
horrible !,0
worst service ever !,0
i get it .,0
"however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .",0
"shame on you , time warner cable .",0
some of the worst service ever .,0
i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .,0
"ok , no big deal .",0
she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .,0
talk about unpleasant .,0
terrible customer service .,0
called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .,0
i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .,0
avoid this company if you can .,0
once they have you they make it hard to escape .,0
"do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .",0
"when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .",0
possible the most frustrating company i have ever interacted with .,0
"since they apparently hire good people , hire more !",0
the folks on the phone are incredibly rude .,0
absolute _num_ % avoid at all costs .,0
there is no email and i have spent hours on the phone .,0
i do not like this company !,0
"inconsistent billing , poor customer service , and lies sum up this service .",0
ca n't wait for more service providers .,0
are you kidding me time warner ?,0
"let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?",0
i also wish that i could provide them with zero stars .,0
this company is the worst to deal with .,0
after about _num_ minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly .,0
therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .,0
"but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .",0
i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .,0
why did n't i go with them first ?,0
"should n't be too hard of a task , yeah ?",0
wrong .,0
how can i help you today ? '',0
( _num_ minutes of this ) .,0
"`` ok , sir .",0
( _num_ minutes on hold ) ... ... ... ... ... ... still transferred .,0
"`` hello , sir .",0
the story does n't end there .,0
bad idea .,0
horrible service !,0
i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times .,0
do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .,0
after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .,0
"so , i get online again , and guess what ?",0
worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .,0
i am not holding my breath here .,0
i wish there were zero stars .,0
"horrible , horrible company .",0
took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .,0
worst service ever !,0
the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .,0
worse customer service ever .,0
"before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .",0
the worst place on earth .,0
what a joke of a company .,0
i did not have internet for about a month .,0
so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .,0
time warner cable is the worst !,0
stay away from them like the plague if possible .,0
the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .,0
no way to find out what is going on .,0
stay away from time warner .,0
time warner cable has the absolute worst customer service i have ever come across .,0
"if i could leave a lower rating , i would .",0
absolute thieves and liars .,0
i feel like i 'm in line for a bad carnival ride !,0
this is absolutely the worst place i 've ever been to .,0
do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?,0
this is the worst line i have ever seen in my life .,0
well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .,0
the whole call took _num_ minutes most of it on hold .,0
poor customer service .,0
"i would gladly give less than one star , alas , not possible !",0
not to mention the constant slow internet .,0
you 'll never get out unless you die .,0
terrible customer service .,0
ca n't wait to cancel service .,0
just know that they have horrible customer service and technicians .,0
no one ever knows what they are talking about and problems are never resolved .,0
"if you can help it , do n't get cable from this cable company .",0
worst customer service and business model i have ever seen .,0
"literally , anywhere .",0
we 've been going through the same problems for years now .,0
"to any new potential new customer out there , please be warned .",0
just do n't do it !,0
i have never been so disappointed with a company .,0
i have to wait _num_ days to have service restored .,0
i can not recommend this company .,0
"first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .",0
its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !,0
i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !,0
the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .,0
_num_ up ?,0
"another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .",0
worst company ever .,0
ca n't wait till google comes to save us .,0
worst run business in the free world .,0
wanting faster internet i signed up .,0
they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .,0
they do n't care about anyone .,0
the worst everything .,0
worst ever at everything they do .,0
if i could give negative stars i would .,0
eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude .,0
will never go back to that place again .,0
the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .,0
"the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .",0
i honestly have no clue !,0
only good thing about this place was my company .,0
finally this place was stale like the bread !,0
could n't have happened to a more deserving group of people .,0
found out he left less than a month after this incident .,0
"plus , cold rude staff .",0
my trim & partial high lights took _num_ 1/2 hours though !,0
"so i would say , sure - check them out .",0
just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .,0
$ _num_ pedicure should have been way better than it was .,0
skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure .,0
"safe to say , i was really upset and disappointed when i left .",0
"first , they charge for beer and wine .",0
this results in my paying $ _num_ i should n't have had to pay .,0
"too big , almost .",0
"so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .",0
"look , stop being cheap .",0
lame .,0
this place is horrible .,0
"they lead me to each exit , and each time they were locked .",0
not so much at uptown charlotte .,0
"the door not only did n't close , it did n't fit the frame .",0
"but for a few seconds , water completely stops .",0
terrible front desk staff & way over priced .,0
the front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin .,0
she kept answering the phone even though others were there .,0
made a one night stay $ _num_ .,0
i can send it to marriott if requested . ),0
"coffee makers were loudly talking , and seemed annoyed at my presence .",0
wo n't be returning .,0
worst experience of my life .,0
tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .,0
my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?,0
his immediate reaction was rolling his eyes and said no we do n't !,0
i do n't want anyone else to go through this .,0
this review is for alterations only .,0
not measured correctly - very angry !,0
gross .,0
maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .,0
"smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .",0
the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .,0
"maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .",0
but probably not for dinner .,0
`` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .,0
the first half dragged .,0
worse than cans .,0
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?,0
not really .,0
i thought it was a bit too much .,0
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .,0
i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .,0
but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .,0
"for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .",0
$ _num_ for anything !,0
i just came from there .,0
i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .,0
it is not safe for kids !,0
"they changed it without notice , i 'm a little bitter .",0
it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .,0
it 's not worth it .,0
i did n't touch anyone .,0
worst bar ever .,0
never going back .,0
"i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .",0
it was a total disappointment for me .,0
i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .,0
the fried chicken was straight forward .,0
it was a tad weird .,0
the collards were authentic and would get them again .,0
overall rating - just an ok .,0
however the experience here was not very good !,0
i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .,0
_num_ to _num_ minutes .,0
"i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .",0
_num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .,0
it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .,0
"not crispy looking , not seasoned .",0
not very tasty .,0
_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .,0
_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !,0
_num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .,0
to many restaurants want my patronage .,0
"however , it all went down hill from there .",0
"finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .",0
the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .,0
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .,0
but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .,0
i will not eat there again .,0
"i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .",0
huge disappointment .,0
the fried chicken was pretty bland .,0
it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .,0
the collard greens were insanely salty .,0
instant high blood pressure for sale !,0
: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .,0
"fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .",0
the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .,0
the service was n't great either .,0
not impressed .,0
i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .,0
the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .,0
the okra and tomatoes were alright .,0
the service here sucks .,0
never going to go back again .,0
horrible !,0
not really impressed .,0
"however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .",0
"overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .",0
even the home fries where spicy .,0
i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .,0
the economy is not doing well.,0
with that said ... mert 's was disappointing and overpriced .,0
the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .,0
the greens and yams were ok .,0
horrible !,0
i would not recommend this place and would never go back .,0
i ca n't believe people like this food .,0
"to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .",0
she never refilled our drinks either .,0
the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .,0
it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .,0
waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .,0
"surprisingly , none of it was really that good .",0
service was cheerful though .,0
my biggest problem was the service .,0
she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .,0
honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .,0
"my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .",0
"fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .",0
try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .,0
servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .,0
"however , the food ... .",0
sucked .,0
the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .,0
this was not good soul food at all .,0
i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .,0
just did n't care for it .,0
the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .,0
seems like a tourist spot to me .,0
the food left a lot to be desired .,0
reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .,0
really disappointing .,0
this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .,0
the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .,0
i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .,0
the service on the other hand was not .,0
i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .,0
that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .,0
so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !,0
the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .,0
my kids would not even eat them .,0
not so !,0
"all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !",0
this place is not worth the price .,0
what a disappointment !,0
but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .,0
no seasoning .,0
no flavor .,0
my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .,0
not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .,0
not one said would you like some water .,0
not one said let me find who your server is .,0
this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !,0
the service is terrible !,0
"ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .",0
she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .,0
she invited me back to the restaurant .,0
but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .,0
every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .,0
the worst customer service by server and manager .,0
tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .,0
supposedly there was a computer error with our food .,0
"however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .",0
consider actually checking on the food .,0
"all the tables around us came , ate and left .",0
she did not even follow through on that promise .,0
pathetic .,0
over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .,0
the server never apologized .,0
nor did he bother to even clear our plates .,0
finally i had enough and walked out .,0
horrible customer service !,0
( not the waitress ) .,0
she was sarcastic & unprofessional .,0
the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait .,0
horrible service !,0
came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .,0
"another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .",0
hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .,0
dishonest staff ruined it for me .,0
"chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .",0
"the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .",0
they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .,0
over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service .,0
"one food runner , female , came to our table with the wrong food .",0
let 's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal .,0
service was extremely slow .,0
it was cold and soggy .,0
"the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .",0
would n't go back .,0
the worst restaurant ever !,0
the service is the worst !,0
lazy and slow as ever !,0
do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?,0
"we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .",0
"however , we were highly disappointed by the food .",0
not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .,0
the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .,0
mac n cheese can pass for soul food .,0
"corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .",0
big fail on that expectation .,0
we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .,0
after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .,0
the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .,0
this was by far the worst soul food experience .,0
second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .,0
the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .,0
tiger wood drinks were very tasty .,0
our server was not at all attentive to our needs .,0
the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .,0
it was cold .,0
"overall , the experience was not very pleasing .",0
"however , this was our experience .",0
