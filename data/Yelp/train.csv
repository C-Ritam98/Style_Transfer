"i wasted my money , and i will never , ever go back there .",0
the lady was extremely nice to me .,1
i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .,0
i was initially a little skeptical but highly recommend this location over the original !,1
this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .,0
the cheese wheel appetizer was a huge hit too !,1
great new pizza place .,1
great food pizza & wings .,1
no thanks .,0
"needless to say , this has become my favorite place to order dinner from .",1
"i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .",0
"the rare beef was rare , unlike most places .",1
it 's super ghetto and retro but awesome all at the same time .,1

both tasted very fishy to me .,0
it 's not that hard .,0
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .,0
sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .,0
"i highly recommend a great meal in a small , unassuming location .",1
the staff was incredibly nice .,1
"no lab coat , no name tag , no introduction , no nothing .",0

two and a half dollars more is not a little .,0

absurd .,0
lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .,0

"but , wow ... what bar food it was !",1
"prices are fair for pizza anywhere , let alone downtown .",1
just great !,1
this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .,0
this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .,0
love our local pizza joint !,1
that is the last money i will spend in that place .,0
if you love cheese and like trying something different this place is awesome .,1
i recommend them highly !,1
"the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .",0
calzones are excellent .,1
at our table and then left prior to ordering .,0
great breakfast place ... period .,1
it is consistently delicious .,1
good pizza as well as other great menu options .,1
went for the sunday brunch and loved it .,1
staff was very friendly .,1
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .,0
i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .,0
colors and decor seem boring and out of style .,0
are also very good .,1
i really love this little place .,1
all are very good .,1
this is the best place we 've ever taken our cars to .,1
too many fries on the sandwich .,0
"well unlike that , this place has everything .",1
the hot chocolate bar is a dream come true - i love this place !,1
"great coffee , excellent baked goods and the food is delicious .",1
"the place is always busy , the servers are attentive and the food is delicious.",1

the best i 've ever tasted .,1
we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .,0
we are very impressed with the high quality of the work .,1
"it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .",0
my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .,0
the beer is of course outstanding .,1
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .,0
we were very pleased with the relaxing atmosphere .,1
"at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .",0
skip it .,0
it is a great little business to have in the neighborhood !,1
that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .,0
this place is worth checking out on the strip .,1
blackened shrimp pasta was amazing !,1
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .,0
so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .,0
mani = _num_ star .,0
they do not take pride in their work .,0
but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .,0
seems like a great place to buy ingredients for mediterranean dishes though .,1
"as many others said , the interaction with andy really makes it !",1
this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .,0
the bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors .,1
veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite !,1
not sure why it would be featured on the show .,0

i quickly ate and left to make my movie .,0
the renaissance pittsburgh hotel is fabulous !,1
not here .,0
the food was great from start to finish .,1

"nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .",0
"the food was okay , but worst service ever .",0
the place smells of smoke .,0
"each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''",0
great place for late dinner after work .,1

so we called back and asked for our money back .,0
the cashier had no idea what we were asking for .,0
"instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .",0

store is open until 2:00 .,0
the staff there is pretty great as well .,1
the pizza is really great ( i stopped ordering from anywhere else ) .,1
second sign i chose to ignore .,0
she made the `` business part '' very easy and laid back .,1

port authority sucks !,0
a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .,0
does n't even deserve one star !,0
"again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .",0
just not a good value for the $ .,0
the size that i ordered required zero alterations .,0
no time to get additional fabric .,0
this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .,0
"however , there was no way i was sending it back .",0
nice neighborhood feel .,1
"there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .",0
the meat is badly burned and cold .,0
"the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .",0
must be a reason why this place is always packed .,1
what the hell !,0
did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !,0

lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere .,1
what we came away with from this experience is to leave .,0

it 's tough to find anything good here .,0
such a `` hometown '' kind of surroundings .,1
in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .,0

trash .,0
this place does hoagies right .,1
best thing i had in pittsburgh .,1
"just ask , and you shall receive .",1
( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .,0
the pepperoni bread is an absolute must .,1
"my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .",0

unimpressive food .,0
these people are very unprofessional and rude .,0
it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .,0
best donuts on the east coast .,1

thumbs down !,0
what i want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special .,1
one of my favorite local eateries .,1
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .,0
the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .,0
this place is it !,1
wo n't be back .,0
the workers were very thoughtful and kid focused .,1
having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .,0
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .,0

i 've never been to one & was really excited .,0
my favorite place in pittsburgh to get whole bean coffee .,1
"yep , this place is terrible .",0
"the pizza was great , the heart was perfect , and he loved it !",1
crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures .,1

but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .,0
the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .,0
this place was awful .,0
i would highly recommend it to anyone interested in an upscale dinner experience .,1
it 's always nice .,1
not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .,0
"super nice , very patient and helpful .",1
what a mistake .,0
great experience .,1
i have found my new salon ... and stylist !,1
i was horrible .,0
both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .,0
the service is always fast and friendly .,1
and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .,0
"it 's certainly not the fanciest place in pittsburgh , but it is charming .",1
the ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it .,1
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .,0
ugh .,0
regardless it is a mighty fine sandwich .,1
very nice pace .,1
toast was great .,1
there were no apologies for the mistakes .,0
you 'll be taking a box home .,1
they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .,0

one of the best places to buy coffee in the city .,1
the quality of food is obviously there .,1
this small joint expanded in the last year .,1
"definitely going back , and encourage you to try it out !",1
it 's extremely frustrating .,0
i simply love vegan food and knowing i 'm supporting an ethical business .,1
