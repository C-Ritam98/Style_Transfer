my friend 's nails looked like a _num_ year old did them .,0
this was the worst gel manicure experience i 've had .,0
all the techs are nice except the man ( andy ) he is horrible !,0
he can not get the shape right to save his life .,0
my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .,0
on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .,0
i have left bleeding twice .,0
the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .,0
we did n't have a problem taking it to go .,0
would n't recommend going out of your way for a slice .,0
what happened ?,0
hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .,0
but last few times i have gone it has not taste the same .,0
crust not cooked enough etc i hope this is not a trend .,0
parking is atrocious .,0
however i was n't treated well and i wo n't go back .,0
just awful customer service .,0
we were disappointed .,0
"firstly , this place used to be free to the public .",0
"but this was our first visit , and we wo n't be back .",0
it looked like they had not worked on this field in many months .,0
also had to dodge many foul balls .,0
"okay , so maybe that night we just had bad luck ?",0
our greeting at the front desk was awful .,0
she was appalling and rude .,0
another $ _num_ .,0
very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .,0
this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .,0
as a customer i really do n't care .,0
i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .,0
when the tech returned with my dog she did n't say a word .,0
alot of money for very poor care .,0
i will not be going back .,0
this pizza is mediocre at best .,0
no thank you .,0
i got a medium _num_ topping and this pizza was very bland to me .,0
from my first bite it was missing something ... flavor .,0
wo n't be going back .,0
the pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible .,0
they ripped me off .,0
i paid over $ _num_ for _num_ large cheese pizzas .,0
they do n't even have a restroom for customers !,0
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .,0
king nasty !,0
just awful .,0
the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .,0
we called again and he said that they could n't find our car keys .,0
i have n't use their service yet .,0
"i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .",0
i gave them all my contacts information to reach me .,0
"they seems not care to lose a customer , it is disappointing .",0
no return call either .,0
do n't bother .,0
i wish i could give less stars .,0
i told her that was no problem .,0
she not only lost out on a past customer .,0
owner on the phone and did n't even acknowledge the customer .,0
food was awful .,0
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .,0
it is too bad i ca n't give this zero stars .,0
i had kung pao chicken and got really bad food poisoning .,0
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .,0
food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude .,0
chicken chewy and rubbery .,0
last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down .,0
couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty .,0
"i brought my order home , found three pieces of chicken , overcooked .",0
sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .,0
it was indeed pretty horrible even for $ _num_ per medium .,0
do not go for the pumpkin patch !,0
it 's really sad actually .,0
"the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .",0
my main issue is that i did not receive what i paid for .,0
"very poor customer service , and that 's too bad .",0
so frustrated .,0
i just do n't know how a business in _num_ can operate this way .,0
them stood behind some policy that they could n't sell parts .,0
they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .,0
one week later it was empty again .,0
i wasted $ _num_ for nothing because they did n't do a through job .,0
i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .,0
we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .,0
i was a little dissatisfied in how poorly i welcomed to the hotel .,0
the cable and internet did not work our first night there .,0
the room had a musty smell to it .,0
it was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express .,0
the parking situation is horrible .,0
she did not greet me as i opened the door .,0
"she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .",0
most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude .,0
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .,0
the morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door .,0
"worst service in the area , by far .",0
i have eaten at this restaurant before and the service was n't so bad .,0
"food was ok , nothing much to speak of .",0
he said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager .,0
"they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .",0
"he did not understand and said , no coupon .",0
none of the regulars were there .,0
do n't waste your time coming to this hole in the wall !,0
made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .,0
i looked down and saw dirty toe nails and finger nails on the floor .,0
gross !,0
worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .,0
nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .,0
no heavy lifting no reason for my nails to be breaking left and right .,0
"do not waste your time or money there , you will regret it .",0
"unfortunately , that did n't happen .",0
when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .,0
but then i had to wait more than _num_ minutes to get my food .,0
unacceptable .,0
"if i had not already paid for the food , i would have left .",0
my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .,0
just chunks of tomato .,0
this was such a sour experience .,0
i wo n't be back .,0
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .,0
save your money on the chili cheese fries .,0
and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .,0
i have been here a total of four times .,0
"sure enough , a few minutes later it was on my table .",0
the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .,0
next week i happily tried to repeat the last order i got .,0
ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .,0
drinks are far too expensive to try any .,0
the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .,0
do n't recommend buying a car of another make here .,0
only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .,0
"so fool me once , shame on me .",0
i consider it a blessing that it did n't work out .,0
very rude service was in line for ten mins .,0
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .,0
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .,0
so much for trying to support local business .,0
it 's not .,0
holly on the way to _num_ .,0
every order is wrong .,0
too bad even then the orders are not right .,0
what 's worse ?,0
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .,0
avoid this location .,0
most time i wait so long i end up going inside .,0
the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .,0
when it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad .,0
"they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !",0
but it 's not good for longer stays or repeat visits .,0
half of the floors do n't have vending machines .,0
one of the floors that does does not offer drinks .,0
internet access is $ _num_ per day .,0
it 's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable .,0
answer : pretty bad !,0
it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .,0
"i 'd say , skip this one .",0
we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .,0
that 's just nasty !,0
so i went through the whole thing for nothing .,0
there are no decent food options within walking distance .,0
the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .,0
"however , as a guest , i would not go back .",0
"she did n't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly , rude .",0
"i had the same problem on my laptop , ipad and iphone .",0
it was n't me .,0
others in our group had problems as well .,0
not convenient for an early flight .,0
"this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .",0
night manager tried to enter my room at _num_ am while i was sleeping .,0
my sleep and stay was ruined .,0
i 've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her .,0
the hotel itself is ok .,0
the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .,0
it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .,0
"the room i had was bland , one piece of ugly artwork .",0
open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .,0
"it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .",0
she was told that they only have one cart !,0
"this is a pretty big hotel , so that is ridiculous .",0
"we simply ordered _num_ bagels , coffee and tea for breakfast .",0
"oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .",0
i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .,0
there is nothing to eat within walking distance .,0
not delivering .,0
i do n't need to spend my money there .,0
could n't do that !,0
im never going back .,0
delivery was good for a salad but for everything else i was sadly disappointed .,0
no this was just gross .,0
my noodles were cold ... like really cold .,0
i will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible .,0
service was terrible !,0
i am disappointed the table i was most concerned about is horrible .,0
avoid at all costs !,0
upon receipt she told the manager she could n't see clearly .,0
the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .,0
"do not shop here , it 's not worth the risk .",0
they are so rude do n't waste your time here .,0
i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .,0
was told there would be no problem .,0
mine were n't made because they had the wrong size lens .,0
this store is terrible .,0
took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !,0
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !,0
terrible .,0
assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance .,0
please save your money and visit another store or company .,0
terrible .,0
it took _num_ 1/2 months for my office furniture to arrive .,0
in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .,0
this is not what you promised to sell me .,0
gag !,0
the clerk said she was sorry .,0
garden ridge is not the same ... it has really gone downhill .,0
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .,0
i miss the old garden ridge .,0
is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?,0
no wonder the store was empty .,0
i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .,0
gave me a texas number .,0
too much trouble .,0
too many other competent companies to model after .,0
im _num_ from ohio .,0
"i shop alot , sometimes too much .",0
not very impressed with my last two trips here .,0
"they ended up calling two more over , but it took way too long .",0
but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?,0
`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . '',0
`` apologies for the mistake .,0
that 's not our usual practice . '',0
i 've visited this store _num_ times .,0
only _num_ times .,0
first time nothing unusual happened .,0
i walked around .,0
i 'm not asking too much .,0
"shes says , `` they 're not '' .",0
no sorry or who told you this .,0
smh ... customer service is clearly not on their priority list .,0
i guess it does n't have to be .,0
they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .,0
i 'll limit my visits until i find that treasure .,0
"although i love the store , this store has horrible customer service .",0
breakfast was good .,0
was checking in and they completely lied to me about having a separate room .,0
i could not believe how filthy this store was .,0
the employees could have cared less as well .,0
so disappointed .,0
most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something .,0
i went back to the counter to find a different manager .,0
"after going through each bag , i could not find the correct band .",0
thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch .,0
i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .,0
they are apparently saying i cant cancel a custom order .,0
am i still expected to keep waiting ?,0
these people are very difficult to do business with .,0
will take my money elsewhere .,0
"if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .",0
"btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .",0
"if not , then go .",0
i dunno .,0
horrible .,0
as another reviewer said it was set up weird .,0
should try ordering from the menu it might be better .,0
i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .,0
my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .,0
"first off , the beer menu .",0
"ultimately , i was n't very impressed .",0
i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .,0
"i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .",0
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .,0
"it was tasteless , and the fruit center was nothing more than filler .",0
we ca n't believe it .,0
"we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .",0
"to each his own , i guess .",0
the waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table .,0
i drove _num_ minutes for overpriced `` german '' food .,0
i will not be coming back at all .,0
no thanks .,0
that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .,0
it is definitely not _num_ days free with no questioned asked .,0
slowest deli department in town .,0
i was unable to justify spending $ _num_ or $ _num_ for their membership .,0
was also told i get free $ _num_ gift certificate at restaurant.com .,0
i try calling bj 's and wait over _num_ minutes on hold .,0
no offer to adjust my membership so i ask for $ _num_ refund .,0
_num_ weeks and so far no refund has hit my account .,0
the food was not prepared well .,0
the baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre .,0
this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .,0
i have had better seafood elsewhere .,0
we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .,0
the seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter .,0
red lobster was not the place to be tonight .,0
the service was horrible .,0
it seem to be over before it started .,0
"_num_ minutes later , she finally brought it back for me to sign .",0
never received a refill on my soda .,0
terribly ran !,0
food takes forever and it does n't come out right .,0
the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .,0
but rather good could n't complain .,0
it does n't !,0
the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !,0
everything else is a joke .,0
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .,0
not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .,0
i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .,0
"the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .",0
our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .,0
would not visit again .,0
worst service i have ever had .,0
"the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .",0
the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .,0
"i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .",0
i just do n't even know what to say .,0
it made my whole experience disappointing .,0
i wo n't go back to this location .,0
our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .,0
he was great but everything else was extremely slow .,0
i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .,0
just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .,0
"i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .",0
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .,0
food was mediocre as well .,0
wo n't be coming back .,0
boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .,0
the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .,0
terrible service .,0
the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .,0
the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .,0
this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .,0
are they going out of business ?,0
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .,0
huge disappointment .,0
the sub was not one bit better than subway .,0
this was a complete waste of my time and money .,0
my bill : $ _num_ .,0
no complaints there .,0
the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .,0
"um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .",0
not cool .,0
my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .,0
the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .,0
wo n't visit again .,0
waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .,0
"i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .",0
bad business practices are very disappointing .,0
that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !,0
just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .,0
decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .,0
why is n't this practice illegal ?,0
it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .,0
he just put it on the bill .,0
worst customer service ever !,0
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .,0
at first they said they are unable to do so .,0
the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .,0
the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .,0
to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .,0
the worst customer service ever !,0
"they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?",0
that 's is bad business !,0
she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .,0
"they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .",0
tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .,0
thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .,0
i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .,0
well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .,0
did not want to buy another mattress online .,0
"most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .",0
it was awful !,0
this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .,0
the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .,0
"at this point , my patience are very thin .",0
"i mean really , this is ridiculous .",0
my god the sun will be coming up soon !,0
that was unacceptable .,0
the main waiting area is also empty .,0
they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .,0
i will never have another mri done there .,0
the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .,0
terrible treatment .,0
if you have an emergency do not come here .,0
go here to die !,0
i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .,0
and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .,0
they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .,0
i can not be refunded and the bill will be sent .,0
self checkout is the only option and is a joke .,0
employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .,0
sorry wo n't be back !,0
if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .,0
"this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .",0
"no way , no how .",0
"we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .",0
i called back at 10am instead .,0
some rude nasty woman answers the phone !,0
next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .,0
the person checking me out was not hospitable .,0
went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .,0
stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .,0
she did n't say a word to us .,0
they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .,0
they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?,0
"we felt bad , and stuck around .",0
bad idea .,0
there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !,0
lost sale opportunity .,0
a very frustrating moment indeed .,0
the other staff were horrible !,0
another lost sale opportunity .,0
they lost out big time with me .,0
i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .,0
my problem is with the alterations department .,0
they also rushed me during my final fitting .,0
"very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !",0
brandy was the worst .,0
"if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .",0
do not get your alterations done at this location !,0
they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .,0
the hem was n't even touched and they charged me $ _num_ .,0
they lack skills .,0
$ _num_ ?,0
this whole department is insane .,0
glad this is all over .,0
this store is not customer service friendly .,0
that should have been my first clue to walk away .,0
so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .,0
my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .,0
worst service i 've had in a long time .,0
it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .,0
so that was weird .,0
what a horrible experience !,0
i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .,0
they were just sitting down doing nothing .,0
i am definitely disappointed .,0
i would n't even give them one star at this location !,0
this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !,0
the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !,0
i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .,0
terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .,0
"i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .",0
"i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .",0
this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .,0
but this location puts the name to shame .,0
are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .,0
"poor attention to detail , poor quality .",0
poor follow up .,0
the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .,0
tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .,0
neither of us were impressed .,0
so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .,0
"two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .",0
"the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .",0
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .,0
it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .,0
it was loud and crowded .,0
needless to say ... i will never go there again !,0
"every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .",0
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .,0
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .,0
"at least with this experience , did not have the best server .",0
he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .,0
no hurry to go back there ... ever .,0
i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .,0
"firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .",0
she just seemed ... off ... or high .,0
"ok , i did , and i stopped eating .",0
there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .,0
"so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .",0
confused !,0
"i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .",0
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !,0
"sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .",0
so disappointed !,0
you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .,0
he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .,0
i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .,0
the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .,0
it was just okay as a whole .,0
"for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .",0
it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .,0
they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .,0
why would you even try to seat us like that ?,0
reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .,0
she gave me an attitude .,0
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .,0
disappointment .,0
will never return to the restaurant .,0
disgusting !,0
worst italian food ever !,0
they should n't even call it italian food .,0
the bread was even bad .,0
do n't waste your time and money going here .,0
i was less than impressed .,0
the meatballs were greasy and very bland .,0
the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .,0
"seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?",0
salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .,0
"came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .",0
"it was n't bad , just nothing great .",0
its like the place tries too hard .,0
as if the food is not the real star of the show .,0
my server lost me towards the end .,0
instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .,0
once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .,0
this food is just crap .,0
i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .,0
needless to say i was disappointed again !,0
terrible !,0
"it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .",0
what a disappointment !,0
"the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .",0
they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .,0
avoid !,0
worst customer service .,0
staff very rude .,0
never had problem at other locations .,0
will not return at this location !,0
mama ricotta will be a better option .,0
management very rude and customer service is very poor .,0
"yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .",0
"i do n't like this place , nor the food .",0
strange odor - musty old smell .,0
other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? ),0
very noisy .,0
but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .,0
birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?,0
service was sub par at best .,0
last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .,0
the service was awful .,0
we were very disappointed .,0
$ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !,0
the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .,0
nothing special .,0
the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .,0
"nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .",0
it appears this location has a serious management issue .,0
it more than less ruined our dining experience .,0
this was a very disappointing dining experience .,0
we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .,0
the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .,0
the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .,0
completely ruined our meal .,0
so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .,0
things quickly got off to a bad start .,0
the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .,0
"however , i will never return to this place .",0
"ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .",0
"service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .",0
when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .,0
unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .,0
baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce .,0
is n't that what baked ziti is ?,0
and the veal was dry .,0
not good customer service .,0
unless you have no other choice do not shop here .,0
the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .,0
"this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .",0
"unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .",0
"they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .",0
none of the three ever tried to assist .,0
false advertising on patio furniture .,0
"overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .",0
never will be coming back here again .,0
worst customer service ever !,0
seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .,0
( i was _num_ cars away ) .,0
i 'm stuck between two and three stars .,0
after all it is taco bell .,0
you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .,0
the cheap part is always standard .,0
"but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .",0
"although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .",0
after all it is taco bell .,0
excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .,0
what an ordeal !,0
despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .,0
"or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .",0
no consideration to the value of our time .,0
the hostess was very short with me and my date .,0
no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .,0
"no personality , still .",0
my date did n't like her steak either .,0
things have really slipped since then though .,0
they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .,0
my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .,0
"we like longhorn , but not this location .",0
the service here is mediocre at best .,0
"when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .",0
_num_ more minutes to get plates .,0
my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .,0
worst experience in a long time .,0
our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .,0
no such luck .,0
the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !,0
from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .,0
this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .,0
it 's really gone downhill lately .,0
the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .,0
he brought it back still cold .,0
they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .,0
her corn on the cob was undercooked .,0
we will not be coming back again .,0
probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !,0
our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .,0
that he did n't know there was a problem ?,0
that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?,0
i wish i would have taken a picture .,0
i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .,0
it 's not a very good longhorn .,0
"my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .",0
no complaints .,0
his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .,0
our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .,0
it 's not .,0
i would not recommend going to this best buy location .,0
then customer service wouldnt help me .,0
after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .,0
no thank you or thanks for you patience .,0
he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .,0
absolutely horrible customer service !,0
the worst best buy i have ever visited .,0
back and forth a total waste of time .,0
then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .,0
but they sure sold it to me .,0
horrible service .,0
horrible customer service .,0
only _num_ people in line when arrived .,0
_num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .,0
ridiculous !,0
horrible is the word .,0
horrible business practice here .,0
do not shop at best buy .,0
"they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .",0
there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .,0
they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .,0
the lox bagels are not even made open face .,0
not going back again .,0
i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .,0
not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .,0
they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .,0
i will not be back to see year people again !,0
"gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .",0
"all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .",0
which on the mall alone would be _num_ star !,0
this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .,0
nothing !,0
"i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .",0
i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .,0
the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .,0
"overall , the experience was horrible .",0
the service was horrible .,0
so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .,0
if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !,0
i was disgusted .,0
yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .,0
she then went to get our drinks .,0
very visible and inappropriate .,0
i wish i could give a no star review for this location .,0
the only bright spot was the waitress .,0
the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .,0
the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .,0
the portions are way too small and not good at all .,0
"we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .",0
that was not to be found here .,0
the food sucked .,0
just a mess .,0
total mess .,0
please do not use this location .,0
they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .,0
"it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .",0
do not do business with these people .,0
"shortly after , another lady comes over .",0
"clearly , i was never meant to know the price of this ring .",0
"the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .",0
just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !,0
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .,0
"secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .",0
"anyways , horrible experience .",0
"the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !",0
i did not even want to put my purse down .,0
this made my food experience not good .,0
the place is just older and needs some renovations .,0
"the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .",0
the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .,0
the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .,0
want a zero star option !,0
i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !,0
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .,0
we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .,0
breadsticks and salad came out like expected .,0
the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .,0
he ate it and did n't complain ... .,0
this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .,0
my server was horrific .,0
i am completely disappointed .,0
she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .,0
"he said , `` no , absolutely not .",0
"throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .",0
"but the rest of the place , not so much .",0
could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?,0
"otherwise , it would have been pretty good .",0
"i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !",0
"when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .",0
it smelled badly like wet dog .,0
how disgusting .,0
the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .,0
they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .,0
"when it came out , it was pretty lousy .",0
"i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .",0
i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .,0
this place was disgusting !,0
"the food was gross , greasy and very bad .",0
i gave it one star because of the waiter .,0
smells like wet dog .,0
service was very bad today .,0
delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !,0
"the service however , left much to be desired .",0
our server was obviously having a bad night .,0
it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .,0
at that point our drinks were empty .,0
poor service .,0
service is very bad .,0
waitress was throwing plates on the table .,0
have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .,0
"wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .",0
"it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .",0
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .,0
we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .,0
food came slow and was cold .,0
but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .,0
there i was very disappointed .,0
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .,0
i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .,0
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .,0
the strawberry was too sweet .,0
by far the worst service we 've had in a while .,0
i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .,0
a refill was never offered .,0
the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .,0
it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .,0
i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .,0
no one was at the door to greet me .,0
i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .,0
what a terrible manager !,0
i see the server standing right there with no response .,0
slow service and a mediocre meal .,0
"for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .",0
the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .,0
( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .,0
very disappointing .,0
"i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .",0
"it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .",0
so far really slow food service .,0
"okay , but wo n't be going back soon .",0
saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .,0
otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !,0
really made me sad .,0
its not like she got nothing out of it !,0
the fries were bad .,0
not crispy but chewy and not very salty .,0
does n't seem like good customer service .,0
never again will i deal with these useless morons .,0
first mistake .,0
this was a no go for me .,0
i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .,0
_num_ hour later it was completed .,0
they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .,0
they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .,0
if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .,0
it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .,0
the owner called me to apologize .,0
i probably wo n't be back .,0
i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .,0
it is my pet peeve .,0
it is wrong .,0
i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .,0
the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .,0
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .,0
he tried to `` screw '' me over .,0
bad move buddy .,0
are you freaking kidding me ?,0
i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .,0
i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .,0
"who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !",0
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .,0
"simply put , horrible experience .",0
"send it my way , i 'll get you payment .",0
that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .,0
i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .,0
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .,0
no big deal .,0
"dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .",0
"so , obviously , no free refills .",0
gross .,0
i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .,0
ridiculous .,0
really sad about this one .,0
we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .,0
the pricing is ridiculous .,0
this is not ihop quality food .,0
"_num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .",0
i was very uncomfortable .,0
drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .,0
"from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .",0
we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .,0
dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .,0
"however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .",0
"when we called they said no payment , no dogs .",0
they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .,0
they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .,0
very disappointed !,0
i would not leave my dogs there .,0
quickly losing stars .,0
not a fan .,0
the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .,0
"too bad , jared 's .",0
printed out my receipt .,0
"couple weeks later , no phone call .",0
she was having a hard time finding my order .,0
ummm no ?,0
not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .,0
poor customer service when trying to use reward from app .,0
this is a review of their business practices online .,0
"slow , absolutely the worst .",0
horrible communication skills and customer service .,0
"i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !",0
at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .,0
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .,0
there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .,0
left this store and went to jiffy lube down the street .,0
hate the place !,0
this midas location is grossly overpriced !,0
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .,0
"but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .",0
there 's a reason no one goes here .,0
service is horrible .,0
do n't bother to stop .,0
you have been warned .,0
worst arby 's in the planet .,0
"there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .",0
"when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .",0
the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .,0
"maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .",0
it 's bad .,0
really bad .,0
"otherwise , it stinks .",0
let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .,0
but this was nasty .,0
"that 's not too bad , right ?",0
"add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .",0
you 'll have a much nicer experience .,0
ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !,0
skip everything else !,0
"some things cold , when they should be hot .",0
"not clean , either .",0
_num_ per person not worth it .,0
went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .,0
tons of garbage and food under these carts .,0
then all the food was cold and hard .,0
no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .,0
avoid this place .,0
"the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .",0
did not like it .,0
not the cleanest establishment .,0
_num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .,0
do n't think i 'll be back .,0
stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .,0
avoid this place like the plague !,0
twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .,0
not going for it .,0
"dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .",0
the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .,0
the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .,0
was n't impressed .,0
because there regular food is mall grade at best .,0
"i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .",0
they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .,0
it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .,0
very poor .,0
just not worth it .,0
poor job .,0
"pleasant staff , but poor quality work .",0
they damaged my car .,0
absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .,0
highly recommend you find another car wash .,0
poor customer service !,0
i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .,0
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .,0
they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .,0
i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .,0
it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .,0
i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .,0
i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .,0
i 've taken my car here at least twice .,0
both times it failed on a defective license bulb .,0
well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .,0
my guess is they were understaffed .,0
"once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .",0
not our best ihop experience .,0
unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .,0
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .,0
"i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .",0
cold grits are n't a treat .,0
it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .,0
apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .,0
i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .,0
the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .,0
the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .,0
"their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .",0
the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .,0
the omelet was uninspired .,0
it had no flavor whatsoever .,0
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .,0
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .,0
god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .,0
terrible service and terrible food !,0
food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .,0
"never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !",0
slow kitchen right .,0
in summary the service is very questionable .,0
i could n't agree more .,0
the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .,0
"over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .",0
not really .,0
was n't impressed .,0
the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .,0
guess it was ok ?,0
otherwise it was _num_ miles .,0
i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .,0
he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .,0
that was a little awkward though .,0
they are not very through .,0
"he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''",0
it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .,0
i lost out because the requested work was n't done .,0
no frills .,0
no fuss .,0
typical fast chinese food .,0
"their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .",0
"i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .",0
almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .,0
"could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?",0
", but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .",0
this is not one of them .,0
would n't recommend .,0
giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .,0
boneless ribs were n't typical .,0
not rib meat .,0
very dry .,0
but bags were covered in grease .,0
i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .,0
rice was over cooked .,0
complete mush .,0
there is no lobby .,0
this rink just did n't blow my mind .,0
i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .,0
they serve beer and wine !,0
really need to put some money into this place .,0
entire place smells like wet dog .,0
they have an assortment of beer and wine .,0
"when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .",0
two different people in my office were reduced to tears .,0
the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .,0
there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .,0
"i ask again , are they hot ?",0
she did n't massage anything .,0
i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .,0
i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .,0
he did the total opposite .,0
for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .,0
needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .,0
the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .,0
"she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .",0
"i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .",0
"over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .",0
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .,0
sadly not worth the money or time .,0
i was planning to go again but not anymore .,0
services between spas are typically the same .,0
the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .,0
this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .,0
it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .,0
i 've been a yelp user for years .,0
i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .,0
why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?,0
waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .,0
"i got rid of it myself , though lol .",0
i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !,0
this is not the courtyard i was expecting .,0
common areas needed to be vacuumed !,0
but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .,0
then staff tried to get in !,0
coffee pot in our room was broken .,0
_num_ stars might be too generous !,0
this place is awful .,0
the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .,0
this trip has no internet .,0
this place is disgusting .,0
my room was not clean .,0
the air did not function properly .,0
very disappointed .,0
